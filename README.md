🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm an Application Security Engineer focused on securing web applications, APIs, and cloud-native systems. I specialize in penetration testing, vulnerability management, and secure code reviews.
My goal is to make security a seamless part of the software development lifecycle — catching issues early, automating checks in CI/CD pipelines, and helping teams build secure applications at scale.
